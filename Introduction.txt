INTRODUCTION
About Me
***************************************************************************************************
I was raised in the Chicagoland suburbs, but now live in rural Wisconsin. My first degree is in
 English Education and I work at a small college's admissions department as an assistant director.
 I decided to pursue a career in software development after helping implement a new CRM for my
 office two summers ago because I really enjoyed the new technical side of my job and saw what a
 positive impact quality applications can have on a work environment. In my free time, I enjoy
 reading. I just finished Stephen King’s Pet Sematary and am now starting Paulo Coehlo’s The
 Alchemist. Along with reading, I spend a lot of time playing the drum set – mostly jazz and Latin
 music. I also play video games from time to time, usually card games like Gwent and Star Realms.

Programming Experience
***************************************************************************************************
I learned C++ during OSU’s 161 and 162, using VIM for 161 and Visual Studio in 162. The next
 language I’m most familiar with is JavaScript, which I learned some of in FullStack Academy’s
 Bootcamp Prep Course last June and practiced regularly on codewars.com through November. I also
 completed Codecademy’s Learn Python class that Fall, but feel like I didn’t retain much. For
 JavaScript, I used CodePen as an IDE, while I never wrote Python outside of the Codecademy
 tutorials. The only other programming-related classes I’ve taken were a Visual Basic course in
 high school and a website building class in middle school, neither of which I remember well.
